# Affordance Study: Parasocial Relationships & Parasocial Interaction

This project investigates how **social media affordances** (specifically, the presence or absence of a comment function) shape usersâ€™ parasocial relationships (PSR) and parasocial interactions (PSI) with influencers.

## Overview
Participants were randomly assigned to interact with a **custom-built fake Instagram feed** of a lifestyle influencer. The manipulation:  
- **Comment-enabled condition:** Users could post comments during the 10-minute interaction period. Their comments were logged and later analyzed (count, length, sentiment).  
- **Comment-disabled condition:** Users viewed the same feed without the ability to comment.  

After exposure, participants completed a survey measuring:  
- Strength of parasocial relationships (PSR)  
- Perceived parasocial interaction (PSI)
- Purchase intention of endorsed products
- Related covariates (e.g., media engagement, attitudes)  
 

## Methods
- **Platform:** Experiment implemented in HTML/JavaScript.  
- **Sample:** Online participant pool (N = 330).  
- **Measures:** Standardized PSR and PSI scales + behavioral log data.  
- **Analysis:** Mixed-method approach combining survey data with text/sentiment analysis of comments.  

## Academic Output
This study is being prepared for submission to American Academy of Advertising [2026 Annual Conference](https://aaasite.memberclicks.net/2026-annual-conference).  

## Industry Application
- **Social platforms:** Demonstrates how interaction affordances (like enabling/disabling comments) can directly impact user engagement and perceived influencer closeness.  
- **Influencer marketing:** Suggests that encouraging user comments fosters stronger parasocial connections, potentially boosting ad effectiveness.  
- **Product/UX teams:** Provides an experimental framework for testing affordances in controlled environments.
